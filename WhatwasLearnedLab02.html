            <p>I remember the first time we were to look at an HTML code. I was somewhat surprised with what I could 
                understand, mainly because I tried to look at it in a simple manner. Like, what does <code>h1</code> mean? 
                Maybe it means "heading 1" in Microsoft Word or somethingâ€”that was how I started understanding HTML.</p>

            <h3>What Was Learned?</h3>
            <p><em>This goes over what I enjoyed learning in this module.</em></p>

            <p>I enjoyed the process of learning how to use tags. At first, it looked (slightly) daunting. I originally thought 
                to start a new sentence, I would need to use <code>/</code> instead of simply pressing enter.</p>

            <ol>
                <li>How to use the<code> code </code> tag</li>
                <li>Using the <code>i</code> tag for <i>italic</i> formatting.</li>
                <li>How to create reference links.</li>
                <li>How to use lists, <i>including numerical ordering.</i></li>
                <li>That adding <code>target="_blank"</code> to a link makes it open in a new tab.</li>
                <li> And so much <strong>more!</strong></li>
            </ol>
