            <h3>What Was Learned?</h3>
            <p><em>This goes over what I enjoyed learning in this module.</em></p>
            <p>I enjoyed the process of learning how to use tags. At first, it looked (slightly) daunting. I originally thought 
                to start a new sentence, I would need to use <code>/</code> instead of simply pressing enter.</p>

            <ol>
                <li>How to use the <code>code</code> tag.</li>
                <li>Using the <code>em</code> tag for <em>italic</em> formatting.</li>
                <li>How to create reference links.</li>
                <li>How to use lists, <em>including numerical ordering.</em></li>
                <li>That adding <code>target="_blank"</code> to a link makes it open in a new tab.</li>
                <li>And so much <strong>more!</strong></li>
            </ol>

            <h3>Additional Lessons Learned (Lab03)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li><p class="special-text">Lab 03 was a little different from what I expected. 
                    I orginally thought this would be somewhat complicated, but I was pleasantly suprised. 
                    Learning the different things about CSS <code>code</code> but the most impactful thing or subject to this project off the top of my head is defintely <code>classes</code>
                    It enabled me to change the style of my HTML code, while not directly interfering with the code itself (from experience, it does <i>kinda</i> breaks some things).
                    Suprisingly the main thing that took a while was tring to get a color scheme that wouldnt looks so "ugly" like the discussion post. 
                </li>
                <li><p class="special-text">Secondly, I found out that I didnt need to make seperate header classes <i>(It was becoming a real tedious)</i> and I found as I was typing I mistakenly put <code>h3 and h4</code> together
                    at first I was like <code>"Oh shoot, I dont think thats how it supposed to work..."</code> then I got curious, I wasnt seeing a red dot thingy (syntax error I guessed) so I checked the preview and it was fine. 
                    Since I was going to make all the headers have the same values I just slapped them together and we got what we have now. Not to mention I could just call the other headers by the same one, 
                    like using h3 three times instead of using it once and moving over to heading 4. I learned this the hard way, <i>(I was getting validation errors)</i>
                </li>
                <li><p class="special-text"> Lastly, I was suprised how straight foward alot of these tags and elements are. Examples are <code>a:hover, highlight, and .special-text</code>
                    The experience from CSIT 111 really helped to understand how code works. Understanding code is really just about common sense, the more I programmed; the more I understood what I was writing and how to read other's programs.
